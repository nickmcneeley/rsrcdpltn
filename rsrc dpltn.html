<h1>how population affects resource depletion</h1>

<p>
2.5 percent of water is consumable and the rest is 70 percent salt water and ice

there is about 180 million tons of oil left and if it keeps getting 
 used up at the pace that it is then it will last another 46 years

 
 too many fishermen is causing a decline in fish and each fisher catches less fish
 
 overpopulation causes deforestation because more houses need to be built and forest get knocked down
